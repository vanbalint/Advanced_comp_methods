#### Remarks

In this app you can see an example of how to use conditional user interface structures, i.e. depending on some of their inputs, other options appear. It also shows some other features, like tabsets, how to add arbitrary HTML text or load an external document written in Markdown, etc. The example is a simplified version of a Shiny application that was found on Internet, unfortunately the link does not work anymore to give a proper credit.
